`VCA <https://vca.itec.aau.at/>`_ is an open source video complexity analyzer. See the online documentation for instructions for building the source.
The primary objective of VCA is to become the best spatial and temporal complexity predictor for every frame/ video segment/ video which aids in predicting encoding parameters for applications like online per-title encoding.

VCA is available as an open source library, published under the GPLv3 license.
